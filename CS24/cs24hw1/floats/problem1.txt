CS:APP3e Practice Problem 2.46, pp.111-112:
-------------------------------------------
A) what is the binary representation of 0.1 - x
0.1110011001100110011
you just do bitwise and with
1.00000.....0 and the original x they give you.

B) what is the approximate decimal value of 0.1-x
you can multiply it out like so
1 * 2^-1 + 1 * 2 ^ -2 ....
= 9.53674316 * 10^(-8)

C)
we take the previous answer and multiple
100 * 3600 * 9.53674316 * 10^(-8) = 0.343322754 seconds,
or 0.0343 due to sig fig

D)0.0343 * 2000 = 68.7 meters
