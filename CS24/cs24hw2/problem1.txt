What does the assembly code do?
-------------------------------

line 1: move the quadword at M[16+%rbp] , x, to register rax
line 2: signed 64bit multiply of constant 3 quadword  with contents of 
        register rax) and implicitly store in rdx:rax
line 3: 64 bit addition of quadword 12 with rax, store in rax
line 4: signed full multiply of quadword at memory location M[16+%rbp] ,x  
        with contents of register rax) and implicitly store in rdx:rax
line 5: subtract quadword 17 from rax


(3 * x + 12) * x - 17
which simplifies to 
3x^2 + 12 x - 17
