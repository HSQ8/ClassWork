assume that %r8 holds a Sphere_Data struct pointer

movq (%r8), %rcx    # Derefernce the Sphere_Data ptr and 
                    # move the class ptr in the struct that it points to
                    # into %rcx
movq (%rcx), %rdx   # Dereference the class pointer and get the function  
                    # pointer into %rdx
movq %r8, %rdi      # Pass the Sphere_Data ptr into the virtual function 
                    # argument according the x64 convention.
call *(%rdx)        # Call the virtual function by its pointer, since the 
                    # argument is already in %rdi
