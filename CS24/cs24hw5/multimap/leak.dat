This program measures multimap read performance by doing the following, for
various kinds of usage patterns:

 * First, a large number of randomly generated (key, value) pairs are inserted
   into an empty multimap.

 * Next, more (key, value) pairs are randomly generated, and the multimap is
   probed to see if each pair is in the map.  The amount of wall-clock time
   taken for this step is measured and used to estimate the time-per-probe
   of the map.

 * Finally, the program prints out how many of the generated (key, value) pairs
   were in the map.  This number should not change regardless of optimizations
   to the data structure, because the same random seed is always used at the
   start of the program.
